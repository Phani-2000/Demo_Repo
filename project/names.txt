git init- Initializing Git Repo
git status- Get the status of files like tracked, untracked,any commits required etc..
git add . - Add all files in this dir to staging area
git add <filename.ext> - Adds this file to Staging area
git commit -m "Some Commit Msg" - Commits the files in staging area to local Repo
git restore --staged <filename.ext> - Removes the file from Staging area
git restore <file> - To discard changes in working directory

git reset <Hash ID of Commit before the Commit we want to delete> - To unstage the changes made in the commit after this commit ID.
Eg: Suppose, we made a commit "Added File". After this we made another commit "Deleted File". But we want to remove remove this commit.
    So, first we do "git log" to get the commit ID for "Added File". Then we use the above cmd to unstage the commit.
    After this cmd, the changes will be unstaged. We can then use "git resore" to discard changes in the working Dir.

git stash- Allows us to temporarily save (or "stash") changes you've made in your working directory that you don't want to commit immediately
